Workload Type         	Application          	Justification
CPU-intensive	       stress or sysbench cpu	  Can generate high CPU load for testing processing capability
RAM-intensive      	stress or memtester	      Tests memory usage limits under load
I/O-intensive	      fio or dd	              Simulates heavy disk read/write activity
Network-intensive 	iperf3	                Tests network throughput and latency
Server application	 nginx	                Represents a real server workload for web requests

Application	CPU	RAM	Disk I/O	Network
stress CPU	High	Low	Low	None
memtester	Low	High	Low	None
fio	Low	Low	High	None
iperf3	Low	Low	Low	High
nginx	Medium	Medium	Medium	Medium

Performance monitoring of each application will be conducted remotely via SSH on the Ubuntu Server.
The approach for each workload type is as follows:

CPU-intensive applications (e.g., stress, sysbench cpu) will be monitored using top or htop to track CPU utilisation and identify peaks.
RAM-intensive applications (e.g., memtester) will be observed with free -h and vmstat to measure memory consumption and swap usage.
I/O-intensive applications (e.g., fio) will be monitored using iostat, df -h, and dstat to assess read/write performance and disk usage.
Network-intensive applications (e.g., iperf3) will be monitored via ip -s link, ifstat, or the application’s built-in throughput reporting to measure network bandwidth and latency.
Server applications (e.g., nginx) will be monitored using a combination of CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics to capture overall resource utilisation during simulated client requests.
Monitoring will be performed at regular intervals during normal operation and under simulated workload conditions. The results will be logged.
