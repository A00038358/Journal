Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS was chosen as the server operating system due to its stability, security, and long-term support. As an LTS release, 
it receives five years of security updates, making it suitable for reliable server deployment. Ubuntu Server has low resource requirements, 
which allows it to run efficiently in a virtualised environment such as VirtualBox. Compared to alternatives like Debian, which uses older packages,
and CentOS Stream, which follows a rolling-release model, Ubuntu Server provides a balanced combination of up-to-date software, stability, and strong community support, 
making it an appropriate choice for this system.
