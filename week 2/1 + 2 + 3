Performance testing will be conducted through remote monitoring using Secure Shell (SSH) access from the workstation to the server. System performance metrics including CPU usage, 
memory utilisation, disk space, and network configuration will be monitored using standard Linux command-line tools such as top, free -h, df -h, and ip addr.
Monitoring will be performed during normal system operation and routine administrative tasks to assess baseline performance. 

SSH Hardening
Disable direct root login over SSH
Enforce SSH key-based authentication
Change default SSH configuration to limit access
Firewall Configuration
Enable UFW firewall
Allow only required ports (e.g. SSH)
Deny all other incoming connections by default
Mandatory Access Control
Apply default or service-specific security profiles
Automatic Updates
Enable unattended security updates
Regularly apply system and security patches
User Privilege Management
Use non-root user accounts for administration
Grant administrative access via sudo only
Network Security
Limit network exposure by using NAT or Host-only networking
Monitor network interfaces for unauthorised changes

One potential threat is unauthorised access through brute-force attacks targeting the SSH service.
If successful, an attacker could gain access to the server and compromise system data or services. 
This risk can be mitigated by disabling root login, enforcing SSH key-based authentication, using strong passwords,
and limiting login attempts through tools such as Fail2Ban.

An unpatched operating system presents a security risk, as attackers may exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software.
This could lead to privilege escalation or remote code execution. Mitigation includes enabling automatic security updates,
regularly applying patches, and monitoring system update status to ensure the server remains protected against known exploits.

Improper firewall configuration or unnecessary open network ports can expose the server to network-based attacks.
This may allow unauthorised access or increase the attack surface. The risk can be reduced by enabling a firewall, 
allowing only essential services such as SSH, blocking all other inbound traffic by default, and regularly reviewing firewall rules.
